# Challenge 816 - Count the Points in a Circle

Count the total number of coordinates on a two-dimensional grid that are inside a given circle. The function has four parameters: the points (provided as a list of dictionaries), the circle's center x coordinate, the circle's center y coordinate, and the circle's radius.

## Examples
```python
points_in_circle([
  { "x": 0, "y": 0 },
  { "x": 1, "y": 1 },
  { "x": 0, "y": 5 },
  { "x": 10, "y": 10 }
], 0, 0, 5) âžž 2
```
## Notes

- Only count the coordinates that are in the circle, not the ones that are on the border.

## Challenge Tests

Here are a series of tests in JSON format that you can use to test your code. Each object in the JSON array has a
key `args` that are a list of parameters your function should take. The `return` key is what your function should return
given the `args`.

If you're writing your solution in Python you can also use the `beginner.codes` Python package to automate testing your
solution. Install it with `pip install beginner.codes`, then create a file for your solution and use the following code:

```python
from __future__ import annotations
from beginnercodes.challenges import test


def points_in_circle(points: list[dict[str, int]], x: int, y: int, r: int) -> int:
    return 0  # Put your code here!!!


test(816, points_in_circle)  # Tell it which challenge to test against
```

And here's the JSON.
