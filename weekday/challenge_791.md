# Challenge 791 - Matrix Subtraction

Two matrices must have an equal number of rows and columns to be subtracted. In which case, the subtraction of two matrices results in a matrix with the same number of rows and columns.

The result of the subtraction of A and B is computed by subtracting the corresponding elements of A and B.

Create a function that takes two matrices and returns that matrix that is their difference.

## Examples
```python
subtract_matrix([
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
], [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
]) âžž [
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0]
]
```
## Notes

- If the matrices cannot be subtracted return an empty list

## Challenge Tests

Here are a series of tests in JSON format that you can use to test your code. Each object in the JSON array has a
key `args` that are a list of parameters your function should take. The `return` key is what your function should return
given the `args`.

If you're writing your solution in Python you can also use the `beginner.codes` Python package to automate testing your
solution. Install it with `pip install beginner.codes`, then create a file for your solution and use the following code:

```python
from __future__ import annotations
from beginnercodes.challenges import test


def subtract_matrix(matrix_a: list[list[int | float]], matrix: list[list[int | float]]) -> list[list[int | float]]:
    return []  # Put your code here!!!


test(791, subtract_matrix)  # Tell it which challenge to test against
```

And here's the JSON.

    {
        "args": [
            [
